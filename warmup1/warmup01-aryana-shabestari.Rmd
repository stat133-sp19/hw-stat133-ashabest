## Cooking Recipe

### Three Bean Chili

![](https://smittenkitchendotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/three-bean-chili.jpg?w=600)

Great for those times when the weather keeps switching between warm spring and blistering winter and just can't decide what to do. This dish promises to "bridge the gap!"

You can vary it however you like depending on your own tastes:

> "You can make it with dried beans or canned. You can make it with dried chiles or fresh or just mild peppers. You can make it with a lot of or a little tomato. You can skip the chili powder if it’s not your thing ..."

Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 medium onion, chopped small
* 1 to 2 peppers of your choice, finely chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 tablespoons chili powder
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1 1/2 teaspoons table salt or 2 1/2 teaspoons kosher or coarse salt
* 1 12-ounce bottle beer
* 1 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes, fire-roasted if you can find them
* 1 1/2 cups mixed dried beans
* 3 1/2 to 4 cups water
* To serve: Lime wedges, sour cream, diced white onion, cilantro, corn or flour tortillas or tortilla chips or rice

Instructions (stove version):

1. Heat oil in the bottom of a medium-sized heavy pot or Dutch oven.
2. Once warm, add onion and cook for 5 minutes, until translucent.
3. Add any fresh peppers and cook for 3 more minutes.
4. Add garlic, chili powder, cumin, oregano and salt and cook for 2 minutes, until browned and deeply fragrant.
5. Add beer and scrape up any bits stuck to the pot. Boil until reduced by half, or, if you’re nervous about alcohol content, until it has all but disappeared.
6. Add tomatoes, dried beans, any dried or rehydrated-and-pureed chiles and the smaller amount of water. Bring mixture to a full boil and boil for one minute, then reduce heat to a very low, gentle simmer, place a lid on your pot, and cook for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, until the beans are tender, stirring occasionally.
7. Add the last 1/2 cup water if mixture seems to be getting dry. If a slightly more sloshy chili wouldn’t bother you, you can add it from the get-go.
8. Serve as-is or with fixings of your choice.

## Euclidean Distance

### Definition

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\overline{\mathbf{pq}}$).

In Cartesian coordinates, if $\mathbf{p} = (p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n)$ and $\mathbf{q} = (q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_n)$ are two points in Euclidean $n$-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$$
\begin{align}
  d(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{q}) = d(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p})
  &= \sqrt{(q_1 - p_1)^2 + (q_2 - p_2)^2 + \cdots + (q_n - p_n)^2} \\
  &= \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (q_i - p_i)^2}
\end{align}
$$

The position of a point in a Euclidean $n$-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$\lVert \mathbf{p} \rVert = \sqrt{p_1^2 + p_2^2 + \cdots + p_n^2} = \sqrt{\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{p}}$

where the last expression involves the dot product.
