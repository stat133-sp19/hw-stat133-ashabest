# Workout 02: Shiny App

_\*\*The `app.R` file can be found in the `savings-simulator/` folder\*\*_

Added here are the files for a [shiny web app](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) that simulates the growth of an investment's value under three modalities:

* without an annuity (`no_contrib`)
* with an annuity (`fixed_contrib`)
* with a growing annuity (`growing_contrib`)

Users can set the initial investment value and annual return rate, as well as annual contribution and growth rate for annuities, and the duration in years.

The deployed app can be found here: https://ashabest.shinyapps.io/savings-simulator/
