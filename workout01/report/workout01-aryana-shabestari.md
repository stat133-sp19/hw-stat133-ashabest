Introduction

Over the past several years, the Golden State Warriors have maintained a solid streak of record-breaking success, and are currently enjoying their status as NBA Champions. When it comes to each game, how do they accumulate the points? Would we see a significant number of 3-point goals, or would we at least see a high success rate when it comes to attempting the shots?

To examine these questions, we decided to take a look at the shooting statistics for several players during the 2016 NBA season, specifically those for Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Stephen Curry. We began by examining their shot attempts with respect to location on the court versus whether the shot was made or missed. We then looked at their success rates (in other words, effective shooting percentages) for 2-point and 3-point field goals, and finally examined the overall shooting percentages.

Shot Attempts by Player
-----------------------

Here we generally see more shot attempts within the 2-point range than past the 3-point line, though Curry is the only one with more attempts past the 3-point line. Other than this, however, there is no clear relationship between location on the court and success of the shot attempted that we can tell from these charts alone, partly due to overplotting of our copious data points.

Effective Shooting Percentages by Player
----------------------------------------

Calculating the shooting percentages for 2-point and 3-point field goals, as well as overall percentage, provides a bit more insight.

### 2PT Effective Shooting %

                name total made percentage
    1 Andre Iguodala   210  134  0.6380952
    2   Kevin Durant   643  390  0.6065319
    3  Stephen Curry   563  304  0.5399645
    4  Klay Thompson   640  329  0.5140625
    5 Draymond Green   346  171  0.4942197

For all players, the success rate here is at the least around 50%. Iguodala has the fewest total shots for the season, but makes the most of them within the 2-point range as we can see from his having the highest percentage. Unsurprisingly, we see him followed by our MVPs Curry and Durant.

3-point goals are harder to make, so naturally we see a drop in effective percentages:

### 3PT Effective Shooting %

                name total made percentage
    1  Klay Thompson   580  246  0.4241379
    2  Stephen Curry   687  280  0.4075691
    3   Kevin Durant   272  105  0.3860294
    4 Andre Iguodala   161   58  0.3602484
    5 Draymond Green   232   74  0.3189655

The ranking order for the first four players from the previous table has essentially been reversed. We also see Curry higher up in terms of success rate with 3-pointers.

However, the overall percentages show a different story:

### Overall Effective Shooting %

                name total made percentage
    1   Kevin Durant   915  495  0.5409836
    2 Andre Iguodala   371  192  0.5175202
    3  Klay Thompson  1220  575  0.4713115
    4  Stephen Curry  1250  584  0.4672000
    5 Draymond Green   578  245  0.4238754

While we saw Curry and Durant within the top three for both 2-point and 3-point percentages, the former now falls near the end, and perhaps this phenomenon is best described by the old saying, "no risk, no reward."

Conclusions and Takeaways
-------------------------

From these we see that even in the professional role, it is invariably difficult to make the shots overall, as the success rate is generally around 50%. However, if other teams usually experience lower effective percentages, this would be considered a high success rate.

It also turns out that we get a fairly even distribution of shots both past the 3-point line and within the 2-point range. However, it is naturally easier to have a successful shot when attempted closer to the basket.
